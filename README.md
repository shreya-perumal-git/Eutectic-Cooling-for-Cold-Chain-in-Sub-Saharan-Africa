# Eutectic Cooling for Cold Chain in Sub-Saharan Africa

Over the course of the semester, my team and I worked with our client, Premuni Grocery, a grocery store company based in Sub-Saharan Africa, to tackle a major issue in their delivery. The company uses trucks and places food in unplugged freezers for transportation, which does not effectively maintain the temperature of the frozen foods. This project aims to design a viable solution that keeps the freshness and temperature of these frozen products during transport, without the need for refrigeration.

In this project, you will find:

Conceptual Design Specifications - The project report clearly defines and communicates the engineering design solution as well as the steps which led us to that solution.

VIP Insulated Cooler Box - The CAD design of the proposed solutions.

Containers In Truck - A CAD showing how the containers fit inside the truck.
